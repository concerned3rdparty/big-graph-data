Analyzing big graph data with hadoop

## Objective

Calculate shortest distances between all pairs of vertices in a graph

## Methodology

[BFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) and [Floyd-Warshall (FW)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm) algorithms are implemented in the MapReduce framework. Parallel BFS is just copy of [the Hadoop tutorial](http://hadooptutorial.wikispaces.com/Iterative+MapReduce+and+Counters) and FW is written by me.
